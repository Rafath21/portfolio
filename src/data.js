For example, if the rate of thefts is high in an area compared to other crime types then the cops need to look out for thiefs more in that area.`,

This data can either just be a date on which the crime happened or additional details like time and place of the incident can also be added. An API at the backend accepts this data and adds it to the database. For implementation purpose, Puppeteer, an automation tool has been used to send multiple requests to the backend and the frontend had been made read-only."],

Just kidding :). This project helped me immensely in understanding how backend is integrated with the frontend. Thoroughly enjoyed building it. Though I ran into a lot of problems (For example: Writing the backend for instagram stories) , but once I tested it for multiple test cases and it all worked just fine- I felt like it was worth it.
